* I am currently an associate professor at the Sepcial Vehicle Research Center, School of Mechnical Engineering, [Beijing Institute of Technology](http://www.bit.edu.cn), Beijing, China.

* I obtained my Bachelor Degree from [China University of Mining and Technology](http://www.cumt.edu.cn) in 2009, Master Degree from [Harbin Institute of Technology](http://www.hit.edu.cn) in 2011, and Ph.D Degree from [Nanyang Technological University (NTU), Singapore](https://www.ntu.edu.sg/Pages/home.aspx) in 2017 under the supervision of Prof. [Yeng Chai Soh](http://research.ntu.edu.sg/expertise/academicprofile/pages/StaffProfile.aspx?ST_EMAILID=EYCSOH) and Prof. [Hua Li](http://research.ntu.edu.sg/expertise/academicprofile/pages/StaffProfile.aspx?ST_EMAILID=LIHUA). After the Ph.D study, I have been working at NTU as a Research Fellow under the supervision of Prof. [Rong Su](http://research.ntu.edu.sg/expertise/academicprofile/Pages/StaffProfile.aspx?ST_EMAILID=rsu).
